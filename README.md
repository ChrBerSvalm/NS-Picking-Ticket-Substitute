## Background
Warehouse is printing picking tickets in Netsuite very often to keep track on items. Printing a picking ticket will screw up some dates which we are maintaining to keep track och delivery dates.

The scripts in this package creates buttons on Item Receipt, wich then fetches sales order data from related sales order and creates a print out which warehouse personnel can use to keep track on items.
